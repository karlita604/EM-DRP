Testing homogeneity in sparse Gaussian
linear regression mixture models - Annik Gougeon

We present a method of determining homogeneity in Gaussian mixture models. A
thorough review of the literature surrounding the establishment of the number of
subpopulations in mixture models is presented.

A modified EM algorithm estimates the unknown parameters while
accounting for the difficult properties associated with Gaussian mixture models.
